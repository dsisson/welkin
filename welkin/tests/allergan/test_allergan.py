        These selenium tests each call a selenium fixture that calls a fresh
        browser instance; that's an architectural decision, that every test
        starts fresh. You could just as easily use one browser session for
        *every* selenium test.

        This selenium fixture is scoped at the function level, and called
        by the test method as `driver`; that fixture is found on:
        welkin/tests/conftest.py::driver()

            Simple navigation flow.

            Use a simple page object model that minimally manages page object
            transitions.

            Note: this is not an actual test, because it has no explicit
            assertions. However, the page object model is performing a
            lot of checks and validations in the background, which allows
            this test case to provide a fairly simple API to page interactions.
